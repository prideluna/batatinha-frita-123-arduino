# batatinha-frita-123-arduino

Inspired from netflix series Round6, this is a simulation of that giant doll.
This plays like this: the doll stars turning its back and when stops its start 
sing something that in portuguese sounds like "Batatinha Frita 1,2,3", this was made with a programmed buzzer. 
After that, the servo make its returns look foward faster. The objective is 
identify some movement, and if it happens, the game is over!

The aim was apply knowledgs of C++ programming while I made something funny.
This project was done with arduino.
